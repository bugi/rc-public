The iterm2 state uses:
  - extra colors and profiles that match my taste
  - font-intel-one-mono
  - default font bash from homebrew (for now; I'm slowly porting my brain to zsh)

The iterm2 keymap binds:
  - ^PageUp -> previous tab
  - ^PageDown -> next tab
  - ^] -> next pane.
  - ^[ -> previous pane:
    Yes that can impact screen, tmux, and telnet.
    You can remove this binding and just use ^].  Next pane cycles through.
    I bind tmux escape prefix to ^o, so this binding of ^[ works will for me.
    You shouldn't be using telnet.
    Screen is very useful, so I'm sure you'll find a way.

My window and tab placement is a bit esoteric.  Look on desktops 1 and 4.

```
brew install bash iterm2 font-intel-one-mono font-inconsolata-nerd-font
```
