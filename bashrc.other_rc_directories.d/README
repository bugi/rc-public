Make symlinks in this directory to other directories
you want me to look in for other bash related files.

Don't check in the symlinks.  No sense exposing your
other rc directories.

You are responsible for arranging them in order.  They will
be sorted in the C locale before use.  Try prefixing with
"00_", "01_", etc for good results.
